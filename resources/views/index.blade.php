      <h3>Our Offer</h3>
      <p>Individuals get educated and engaged in a way that helps the country and the community. Thus, we offer financial support throughout your time at university for all living expenses, help and guidance for your social project and extra-curricular education on peacebuilding and reconciliation. The amount of the scholarship depends on the region where you live and ranges from 50-70€. You will also receive a certificate from us after successfully taking part in the scholarship program.</p>

      <h3>Criteria</h3>
      <p>There are several criteria for the evaluation of the application. Eligible to apply are those who are financially in need. For this intake, we will only accept women applicants. As it is our vision to obtain a sustainable effect, you will need to develop a personal project. We would like to encourage you to develop your own original idea to improve the social conditions in your area. The project itself needs to be realistic and achievable. This will be planned and/or started during your studies and implemented after your graduation.</p>
      <p>Please describe shortly your idea for a personal project which would help to develop your region or society. If you plan to carry out the project in cooperation with a partner (whether it is another scholarship holder, fellow student or NGO) please state their name and their specific roles.</p>

      <h3>Application</h3>
      <p>Do you think you are a suitable candidate for a scholarship? We are happy to receive your application.</p><br>
